        <p>Your organization can start using Solstice Cloud at any time by quickly onboarding your Solstice Pods into the Solstice Cloud management portal from the Solstice Dashboard app. The first time you onboard Pods into Solstice Cloud from Solstice Dashboard, you will be prompted to create a Solstice Cloud account, which will be your organization's master account for Solstice Cloud management. </p>
        <p> Only a single master Solstice Cloud account is needed per organization, and it is strongly recommended you import all your organization's Solstice Pods into Solstice Cloud using this account. You can also use your master Solstice Cloud account to invite other users to join Solstice Cloud management for your organization in a variety of user roles. Inviting any additional users from the master account allows those users  to access the same set of Pods and data for your organization.
