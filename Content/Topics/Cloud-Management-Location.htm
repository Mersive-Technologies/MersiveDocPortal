        <h1>Pod Location Configuration Settings</h1>
        <p>Location features in Solstice Cloud use GPS estimates that are learned from <a href="Info-Location-Services.htm" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Solstice Location Services</a> to automatically group your Pods into categories for Country, City, and Building. These categories are just like other categories, except that they are populated automatically and don’t require editing. This allows a user to walk into a room, open the Solstice app, and see the Pod they are physically closest to at the top of the display list. If the automatic categories aren't intuitive enough for users, you can assign a “friendly name” for each  building which end users will see when they open the Solstice app. </p>
        <p>Additionally, for administrative purposes, Solstice Cloud admins can easily segment groups of Pods based on their location while managing template configurations, viewing usage analytics, monitoring uptime, and much more. Admins can use an interactive map to see how Pods are clustered together based on their location, including fine tuning the location of a Pod down to a few feet or even identifying which floor of the building the Pod is on.</p>
        <p>The use of Solstice Location Services requires the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pods must be imported into Solstice Cloud</li>
            <li>Pods need location services enabled (<a href="Cloud-Template-Room-Intelligence.htm" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Manage &gt; Templates &gt; Room Intelligence</a>)</li>
            <li>Pods must be running Solstice version 5.1 or later</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pod Location Views</h2>
        <p>There are two different ways to view the locations of Solstice Pods included in your organization in Solstice Cloud. These views can be found in Solstice Cloud under <b>Manage &gt;&#160;Location</b>.</p>
        <p>In the map that appears, the following views are available in the bottom left corner: 
						<ul><li><b>Cluster by Pods</b> shows all Solstice Pods in your organization clustered by location. Click on a Pod cluster to zoom in on Pods in that location.</li><li><b>Cluster by Buildings</b> shows Solstice Pods in your organization clustered by building assignment. Zoom in to view finer building location details, including individual Pod locations within buildings (within two stops of maximum zoom).</li><li><p class="note">Pods not assigned to a location will be represented on location maps using an estimated initial location.</p></li></ul></p>
        <p>Clicking the dot representing an individual Pod will display that Pod's configuration settings. You can then perform the following location-related actions from the Pod configuration page:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#howto_LocationNewPod">Set the initial location of a Pod</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#howto_ChangeLocationPod">Change the location of a Pod</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#howto_Fine-tunePodLocation">Fine-tune the location of a Pod</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#howto_LocAddBuilding">Add a new building location</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#howto_RenamePod">Name a Pod for its location</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>If a Solstice Pod has never been assigned to a location, its configuration page will prompt you to assign the Pod to a building.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the left sidebar of Solstice Cloud, navigate to either <b>Manage &gt;&#160;Pods</b>  or <b>Manage &gt; Location</b>.</li>
                    <li>In the Pods table that appears, open the Pod configuration page by clicking the name of the Pod you want to assign a location to.
						<p class="tip">If you manage a large number of Pods, you can reduce the number of Pods displayed in the table by entering all or part of the Pod name in the search box or by setting a filter.</p></li>
                    <li>The map at the top of the Pod Configuration Settings page will indicate the Pod's location is not set, and a <b>Set location</b> box will appear.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>From the <b>Select building</b> menu, choose the appropriate building for the selected Pod and click <b>Next</b>.<p><img src="../Resources/Images/ex_CloudMngLocationSetLoc.png" style="width: 300px;" /></p></li><li>If the desired building is not in the list, click <b>Add New Building</b> and follow the prompts. (See details on how to <a href="#howto_LocAddBuilding">add a building</a> below.) You can then select it from the list.</li><li>Click <b>Next</b>.</li></ol></li>
                    <li>The location is now set for the Pod, and the map will zoom in on the Pod's location. From here, you can view and <a href="#howto_ChangeLocationPod">change</a> or <a href="#howto_Fine-tunePodLocation">fine-tune</a> the location of a Pod.</li>

                <p>If a Solstice Pod has previously been assigned to a location, the bottom of the map on its configuration page will display the building, floor, city, and country for that Pod. The building and floor selections can be modified.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the left sidebar of Solstice Cloud, navigate to <b>Manage &gt; Location</b>.</li>
                    <li>Scroll down to the Pods table, and click the name of a Pod that has an assigned location in the Building column.
						<p class="tip">Click the Building column header twice to sort Pods already assigned to buildings to the top of the table.</p></li>
                    <li>Below the map of the Pod's location, location details appear. Click into the <b>Building</b> field without clicking the dropdown arrow.

                <p>After a Solstice Pod has been assigned to a location, the Pod's configuration page will show a zoomed-in map of that location. If the Pod appears in the wrong place in the building, its location can be fine tuned.</p>

                    <li>In the left sidebar of Solstice Cloud, navigate to <b>Manage &gt; Location</b>. Scroll down to the Pods table, and click the name of a Pod that has an assigned location in the Building column.
