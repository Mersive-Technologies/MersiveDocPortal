    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Configure Solstice Pods for SES</h1>
        <p>Solstice Pods should be configured to use the Solstice Edge Server (SES) by configuring them to use SES for SDS (Pod discovery) and proxy services. These can changes can be made in Solstice Dashboard or through a Pod’s local configuration panel (accessed by attaching a USB keyboard/mouse to a USB port on the back of the Pod).</p>
        <h2>Configure the SDS Host </h2>
        <p>Setting a Pod’s SDS Host to the SES server's IP address makes that Pod known to SDS (Solstice Discovery Service) running within SES. This makes the Pod discoverable to users in the Solstice app. </p>
        <p>In the screenshot below, a Pod named Phobos is being configured in the Solstice Dashboard &gt; Network tab. The IP address of the SES (in this example, 192.168.1.26) is entered in <b>SDS Host 1</b> in the <b>Display Discovery</b> section. Checking <b>List display to Solstice Directory Service</b> allows this Pod’s display to be easily found by users in the Solstice app.</p>

        <h2>Configure the http and https Web Proxy</h2>
        <p>In the same Network tab of Dashboard are also the Web Server Proxy settings, where you can set proxies for http and https traffic. A <b>Web Proxy IP Address</b> and <b>Web Proxy Port</b> must be specified. If your proxy requires a login, also enter a <b>Login Name</b> and <b>Password</b>. The port used for the SES proxy is 3128. The <b>Exclusion List</b> and <b>Don’t use the proxy server for local addresses on the same subnet</b> can be left blank because these types of configuration are specified in SES itself.</p>
