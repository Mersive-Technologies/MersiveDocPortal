        <p>By default, the Video Stream DSCP field is set to 101110, which is "Expedited Forwarding" with a precedence value of 46. The Audio Stream DSCP&#160;field defaults to 101000, which is CS5 with a precedence value of 40. Packets with a lower precedence value might be dropped by QoS-enabled routers on the network in favor of higher precedence packets. Mersive recommends using the DSCP Pool 1 Codepoints defined by the IETF.</p>
