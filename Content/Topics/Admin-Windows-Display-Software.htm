            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The Solstice display menu lets in-room users manually bring the display out of moderated mode, lock the display, or disconnect all users. </p>
                <p>To access the Solstice display menu when the Solstice Windows Display is running, click the Solstice icon on the right end of the presence bar that appears on the bottom of the display (using a USB mouse or via a supported touch screen). If the presence bar is not visible, use a mouse to right-click on the display or share content to the display to show the presence bar.</p>

                    <li><b>Communication Ports</b> allows the administrator to select the Solstice base port and reflects changes to additional ports when the base port is changed. Solstice always uses three sequential ports beginning with the base port, plus port 80 for web configuration and user app access.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <b>Security</b> tab allows admins to designate various security settings, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Administration</b> allows for password-protection of access to the Solstice Configuration Panel, in order to restrict access to the configuration options and/or lock a specific configuration. The password set here is required for local and web-based configuration.</li>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Solstice Windows Display Software running on a host computer is able to integrate with external video sources using a frame grabber or capture card. Using the Video Feeds feature in the Solstice Windows Display Software configuration, a Solstice session can include live feeds with audio from any video source connected to the display host computer. External video feeds could include video conferencing equipment, DVD/Blu-ray players, video recorders, etc.</p>
                <p>It is recommended that users connect USB video sources to integrated USB slots on the host computer’s motherboard, rather than stand-alone USB cards, to reduce the processing and memory demands on the computer. Generally, integrated USB slots are located on the back of the host computer.</p>
                <p>To utilize attached video sources, the Solstice Windows Display Software host computer must have a DirectShow-compatible frame grabber or capture card. Install the card per the manufacturer’s specifications. Install the drivers that came with the card.</p>
                <p>Audio is only supported on certain frame grabber cards. Check the manufacturer’s specs to determine if the card supports audio. For Apple TV or HDCP-protected content to be shared, a Datapath frame grabber card is required.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once the card is installed and the external source is connected to the display host computer, launch the Solstice Windows Display. </li>
                    <li>Access configuration options for the Solstice Windows Display, either via the local configuration menu or from Solstice Dashboard.<p><img src="../Resources/Images/ex_SolsticeWinDisplayConfigVidFdr.png" style="width: 80%;" /></p></li>
                    <li>Select the <b>Appearance and Usage</b> tab and scroll down to the <b>Video Feeds</b> section.</li>
                    <li>Check <b>Capture Source Feature Enabled</b> and click <b>Apply</b>. A list of attached Video Feeds will appear.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Enable each feed individually in the first/left column. </li><li>To change the resolution of the Video Feed source, double click the <b>Resolution</b> column, and click the arrow for a dropdown menu with resolution options. </li><li>If the frame grabber or capture card supports audio, select the box in the <b>Audio</b> column. </li><li>Click <b>Apply</b> when all settings changes are complete.</li></ol></li>
                    <li>On the Solstice Window Display interface, click the Share Media Button in the bottom left corner of the display.<p><img src="../Resources/Images/ex_SolsticeWinDisplayShareMedia.png" style="width: 50%;" /></p></li>
                    <li>Click <b>Attached Sources</b> and select the name of any video feed(s) enabled in the Solstice Configuration Panel.</li>

        <h2>How To Check for DirectX 11</h2>
        <p>These steps will help you verify that your Windows host computer has DirectX 11 or better graphics:</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Step 1 – Launch the DirectX Diagnostic Tool</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>From your Windows host computer, search for the DirectX Diagnostic Tool by entering ‘dxdiag’ in the search box. Click the ‘dxdiag.exe’ program in the results to launch the program.</p>

        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Step 2 – Verify Software and Hardware Versions of DirectX</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Once the DirectX Diagnostic Tool launches, check the software version of DirectX on the <b>System</b> tab. Verify it is 11 or higher.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/ex_SolsticeWinDisplayDxdiagSoftware.png" style="width: 80%;">
                    </img>
                </p>
                <p>Then check the hardware version of DirectX, which is labeled <b>DDI Version</b> on the <b>Display</b> tab. It should also be 11 or higher.</p>
                <p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If both the DirectX software and hardware versions are 11 or higher and your Windows host computer meets the other minimum specifications, you can proceed to install and use the Solstice Windows Display Software. If your DirectX software version is not 11 or higher, check <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/d1f5ffa5-dae2-246c-91b1-ee1e973ed8c2" target="_blank">how to install the latest version of DirectX</a>.</p>
                <p>If your DirectX hardware version, labeled <b>DDI Version</b> in the diagnostic tool, is not 11 or higher, you will need to update the host computer’s graphics card or select another host computer to install Solstice Windows Display Software on.
