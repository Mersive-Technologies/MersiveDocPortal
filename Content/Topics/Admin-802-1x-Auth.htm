        <h1>802.1x Authentication</h1>
        <p>802.1x is a way for network administrators to restrict access to their switched network. There are benefits to doing this, from something as mundane as preventing a well-meaning employee from “accidentally” bringing down your network by plugging in a Linksys router from home, to avoiding someone from maliciously trying to disrupt or intercept traffic on your network after they gain physical access.</p>
        <h2>Solstice's Supported Configurations</h2>
        <h4>EAP Methods (authentication schemes)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>PEAP</b> - Simple, secure username and password-based authentication</li>
            <li><b>TLS</b> - Certificate-based authentication. The Solstice Pod is loaded with a specific private key and a certificate that has been signed by your Certificate Authority. This is a “mutual implicit model” of trust, i.e. your networking hardware sees the pod sending a certificate that was signed by a CA that it trusts, and the pod uses the CA file uploaded through the Solstice Dashboard to validate the networking equipment’s certificate as well.</li>
            <li><b>TTLS</b> - The Solstice Pod uses a username and password to authenticate, but uses the CA-signed certificate you upload to make sure the networking equipment is legitimate before sending over any sensitive information. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Phase 2 (password authentication) </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>None - No Phase 2 Authentication is needed</li>
            <li>MSCHAPV2 - Username and password authentication </li>
            <li>GTC</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The differences are all very subtle and are just different methods of doing username/password authentication.</p>
        <p>How To</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">Load an 802.1x Certificate using EAP-TLS&#160;Method</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">For more information, see ____ topic. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">802.1x Authenticated Networks</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">Gen 2i  and Gen3 Pods may attach to Ethernet networks that require a specific certificate.  Certificate upload options will change based on the EAP Method selected. For example, TLS requires both a CA certificate and User certificate, while PEAP just asks for the CA certificate. Supported certificate file types are .cer, .der, .crt, .pem, .pfx (ua cert, ca cert, private key, password protected (solstice wouldn't decrypt password, silent fail), and .p12.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">Identity (maybe shouldnt have underscore)</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">password for TLS is for pfx</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">When configuring these settings, ensure there is network access between the Pod and the Windows machine running Dashboard. You must also ensure that the Pod has access to a timeserver so that it can validate the certificate</p>
