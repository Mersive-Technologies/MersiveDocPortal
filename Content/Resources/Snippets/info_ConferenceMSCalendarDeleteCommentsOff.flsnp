        <p class="note">For Solstice to auto-launch a scheduled video conference from the link in the body of a Microsoft 365 meeting invitation, the Microsoft Exchange server setting <code>DeleteComments</code> must be changed to <code>$false</code> for the room's Exchange or 365 mailbox account. When set to <code>$true</code> (default), the body of incoming meeting requests is removed, and the video conference cannot be auto-launched. For details on this Microsoft server setting, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/set-calendarprocessing?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank">Microsoft documentation</a>.</p>
