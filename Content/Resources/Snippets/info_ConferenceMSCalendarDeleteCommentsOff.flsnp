        <p class="note">For better integration with Solstice, the Microsoft Exchange server parameter <code>DeleteComments</code>, which removes the body of incoming meeting requests after a response has been sent, should be changed to <code>false</code> for a room's Exchange or O365 calendar account. This allows Solstice to auto-launch a scheduled web conference from a link in the body of the meeting invitation.</p>
