        <p class="note">MSI and SCCM installs of the Mersive Solstice app store their settings in a central shared location (e.g., <code>C:\ProgramData\Mersive\ALLUSERS\Solstice\Client)</code>, not in each user's home directory. This allows for centralized management of these settings and the ability to update them for all users at installation time. </p>
