                <p>Most of the network settings used by the Solstice Windows Display Software are inherited from Windows, but the Solstice <b>Network</b> tab controls several Solstice-specific settings, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Communication Ports</b> allows the administrator to select the Solstice base port and reflects changes to additional ports when the base port is changed. Solstice always uses three sequential ports beginning with the base port, plus port 80 for web configuration and user app access.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Display Discovery</b>, the admin may specify SDS servers to allow users to easily "discover" and connect to the Solstice Windows Display. See the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="SDS-Introduction.htm" target="_blank">Introduction to Solstice Display Discovery</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"><a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/sds-introduction.htm">Introduction to Solstice Display Discovery</a></MadCap:conditionalText> to learn more about SDS.</li>
                    <li><b>Web Server Proxy</b> allows Solstice Windows Display Software instances to be activated and licensed when deployed behind a secure web server proxy. Both HTTP and HTTPS options are available, with web proxy IP address, port designation, and login credentials required for both.</li>
                    <li><b>Quality of Service</b> packet headers can be enabled to allow Solstice traffic to be differentiated and prioritized on the enterprise network by utilizing the IETF-defined quality of service (QoS) header information for enabled enterprise networks that support differentiated network traffic via QoS.

                </ul>
                <p>The <b>Security</b> tab allows admins to designate various security settings, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Administration</b> provides the following options to improve security:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Set an <b>Admin Password</b> to restrict access to the Solstice Configuration Panel and lock a specific configuration and optionally <b>Enforce password validation rules</b> (8-character minimum, one uppercase and one lowercase character, one number or special character) for the admin password. This password is required for local and web-based configuration.</li><li>Admins may also choose to <b>Always serve the Solstice client via port 443</b> for unsecured networks where users may be subject to man-in-the-middle redirects. Enabling this configuration may require additional steps for the user to authorize the use of this port on their device.</li><li>Enable <b>Redirect to HTTPS Hostname</b> to automatically redirect a user that enters the Pod IP address in their browser to the HTTPS hostname as determined by a reverse DNS lookup by the defined DNS server.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><b>Access Control</b> designates the security mode that determines how users access the Solstice session and post to the display. The options include:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><b>Screen Key Enabled</b> requires users to enter the Screen Key, which can be shown in the main Solstice display area and in the bottom presence bar, to connect to a Solstice collaboration sessionto to view the session via browser look-in. Clearing this box allows anyone on the network to connect to a display with no restrictions.</li><li><b>Moderated Approval</b> enables or disallows moderated sessions. If enabled, a user may connect and start a moderated session. The moderator will have full sharing rights and control of the display. Both joining and sharing media posts must be approved by a moderator, and non-moderator users cannot control shared content. Moderators can promote other users to moderator status once they have been admitted to the session.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><b>Encrypt Client/Server Communications</b> to secure Solstice network traffic between the Solstice Windows Display and Solstice user apps using a standard RSA/SHA cipher with a 2048-bit private key. This includes network traffic related to configuration via Solstice Dashboard. By default, the Solstice Windows Display server is loaded with a self-signed CA certificate from Mersive that is used when a Pod receives HTTPS connections. Admins may also upload a custom CA certificate bundle to be used instead.

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><a name="video_feeds"></a>Solstice Windows Display Software running on a host computer is able to integrate with external video sources using a frame grabber or capture card. Using the Video Feeds feature in the Solstice Windows Display Software configuration, a Solstice session can include live feeds with audio from any video source connected to the display host computer. External video feeds could include video conferencing equipment, DVD/Blu-ray players, video recorders, etc.</p>
                <p>It is recommended that users connect USB video sources to integrated USB slots on the host computer’s motherboard, rather than stand-alone USB cards, to reduce the processing and memory demands on the computer. Generally, integrated USB slots are located on the back of the host computer.</p>
                <p>To utilize attached video sources, the Solstice Windows Display Software host computer must have a DirectShow-compatible frame grabber or capture card. Install the card per the manufacturer’s specifications. Install the drivers that came with the card.</p>
                <p>Audio is only supported on certain frame grabber cards. Check the manufacturer’s specs to determine if the card supports audio. For Apple TV or HDCP-protected content to be shared, a Datapath frame grabber card is required.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once the card is installed and the external source is connected to the display host computer, launch the Solstice Windows Display. </li>
                    <li>Access configuration options for the Solstice Windows Display, either via the local configuration menu or from Solstice Dashboard.<p><img src="../Resources/Images/ex_SolsticeWinDisplayConfigVidFdr.png" style="width: 80%;" /></p></li>

        <h2>How To Check for DirectX 11</h2>
        <p><a name="directX11"></a>These steps will help you verify that your Windows host computer has DirectX 11 or better graphics:</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Step 1 – Launch the DirectX Diagnostic Tool</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>From your Windows host computer, search for the DirectX Diagnostic Tool by entering ‘dxdiag’ in the search box. Click the ‘dxdiag.exe’ program in the results to launch the program.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Step 2 – Verify Software and Hardware Versions of DirectX</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Once the DirectX Diagnostic Tool launches, check the software version of DirectX on the <b>System</b> tab. Verify it is 11 or higher.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/ex_SolsticeWinDisplayDxdiagSoftware.png" style="width: 80%;">
                    </img>
                </p>
                <p>Then check the hardware version of DirectX, which is labeled <b>DDI Version</b> on the <b>Display</b> tab. It should also be 11 or higher.</p>
                <p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If both the DirectX software and hardware versions are 11 or higher and your Windows host computer meets the other minimum specifications, you can proceed to install and use the Solstice Windows Display Software. If your DirectX software version is not 11 or higher, check <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/d1f5ffa5-dae2-246c-91b1-ee1e973ed8c2" target="_blank">how to install the latest version of DirectX</a>.</p>
                <p>If your DirectX hardware version, labeled <b>DDI Version</b> in the diagnostic tool, is not 11 or higher, you will need to update the host computer’s graphics card or select another host computer to install Solstice Windows Display Software on.
