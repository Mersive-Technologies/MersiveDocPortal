        <p><a name="client-server_encrypt"></a>This setting allows Solstice network traffic between a Solstice display and Solstice user apps to be encrypted using a standard RSA/SHA cipher with a 2048-bit private key. This also includes network traffic related to configuration via either the Solstice Dashboard, the display’s web-based configuration (if enabled), or Solstice Cloud management. When this option is enabled, Dashboard will also send Solstice Local Release updates via port 443. </p>
        <p>By default, Solstice display servers are loaded with a self-signed CA certificate from Mersive that is used when a display receives HTTPS&#160;connections. However, you may also upload a custom CA certificate bundle to be used instead. Note that the display will always use the CA certificate for HTTPS traffic, even when Solstice client-server encryption is disabled.
