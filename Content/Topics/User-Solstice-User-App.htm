        <h1>Mersive Solstice App</h1>
        <p>Meeting and collaboration session participants can connect to a Solstice display with the Solstice user app, which can be installed on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices (such as laptops, tablets, and phones) to connect and share media to the Solstice display. Note that the user device and Solstice display must be connected to the same network to be able to connect to one another.</p>
        <p>The Solstice user app may be installed in one of two ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download the user app from<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> the <a href="https://www.mersive.com/download" target="_blank">Solstice Download Center</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> mersive.com/download</MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
            <li>Download the app directly from the Solstice Pod by visiting the URL listed on the Solstice display. </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p class="note">Admin permissions are not required to install the Solstice app. However, elevated permissions are required to install the lightweight drivers needed to share the Solstice display's collaboration space with a web conference. </p>
        <h3>Supported Operating Systems </h3>
        <p>The Solstice app is supported on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices running the follow operating systems. Operating systems marked with an asterisk (*)&#160;support Solstice Conference capabilities. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows 8, 10*</li>
            <li>Windows Server 2016, 2019</li>
            <li>macOS Catalina*, Big Sur*</li>
            <li>iOS versions 13, 14</li>
            <li>Android versions 10, 11</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other Requirements </h3>
        <p>The version of your Solstice user app in relation to the version of Solstice running on the Solstice display you are connecting to can affect your experience. There are two different compatibility requirements, depending on how you intend to use Solstice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For content sharing, control, and markup capabilities, newer versions of the Solstice app are supported when used with a Solstice Pod within three (3) minor software versions of the app. For example, a user with the 5.4 Solstice app will be able to share content to Solstice Pods running software versions 5.4, 5.3, or 5.2, as well as use markup tools and control sharing options.</li>
            <li>However, to use Solstice Conference to make content shared to the Solstice display available to a web conference, the Solstice user app must be on the same software version as the Solstice Pod it is connecting to. For example, if a user is connecting to a Solstice Pod running software version 5.4, users will need the 5.4 version of the Solstice app to use Solstice Conference functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Change Your Solstice App Settings</h3>
        <p>You can update the Solstice settings on your device by opening your Solstice app and going to the <b>Settings</b> tab. Changes to your app settings are immediately saved. You can find more information about each setting option below: </p>
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">General
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Your display name</b>: How your name will appear in the collaboration session.</li>
            <li><b>Notifications</b>: Set which notifications you would like to receive: None, Critical, or All notifications. </li>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/info_UserAppNotificationsOffConfWarning.flsnp" />
            <li><b>Solstice Discovery Service Address</b>:  If your organization has implemented Solstice Discovery Service (SDS), the SDS IP address should be entered here. This is one of the ways that Solstice displays on your organization’s network appear in your list of available displays. For more information on the SDS address for your organization, contact your IT administrator.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Control
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quick Share Desktop</b>: If enabled, Solstice will automatically share your desktop to the Solstice display after connecting. </li>
            <li><b>Auto share audio with desktop</b>: If enabled, your desktop audio will automatically be streamed to the Solstice display when you share your desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Hide on desktop share</b>: If enabled, the Solstice app window will be automatically hidden when you share your desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Solstice Location Service</b>: If enabled and location services are turned on for the Solstice display, the Solstice app will reorder the list of discovered Pods to show displays that are closest to you first, streamlining the connection process by allowing you to quickly connect to displays you are physically near. <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><b>Auto-disconnect sensitivity menu</b>: Enabling the Solstice Location Service also allows Solstice to learn over time the location of meeting spaces. This allows the app to automatically prompt you to disconnect after leaving a meeting while still connected and sharing to a Pod. Use this menu to turn on auto-disconnect functionality and set the sensitivity that location services will use to automatically disconnect the device.</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Extended Presentation Mode</b>: If enabled, PowerPoint slide shows shared in the Solstice app will show only the slides on the Solstice display. Presenters should enable Presenter View in PowerPoint to view their speaker notes and access other presenter tools on their laptop. This feature is currently available on Windows.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conference
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Calendar integration</b>: You can integrate your personal Microsoft 365 calendar with your Solstice app, allowing Solstice to detect and auto-launch any scheduled web conferences on your calendar when you connect to a Solstice display. This is supported for Windows or macOS laptops only. See below for details and directions.</li>
            <li><b>Conference HotKey</b>: This setting allows you to configure the shortcut command to quickly open the Solstice Conference pop-up without having to click the icon in your system tray. By default, the hotkey setting is Ctrl+Alt+C on Windows and Cmd+Opt+C on macOS. </li>
            <li><b>Share Pod Display</b>: When enabled, this setting allows you to share the Solstice display's collaboration space to your web conference. In your conferencing software, the Solstice display will appear as a virtual display (usually Screen 2) that can be shared with the meeting. Disabling this feature can improve performance on some host devices.</li>
        </ul>
