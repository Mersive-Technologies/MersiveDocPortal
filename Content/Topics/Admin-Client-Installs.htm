        <h1>Deploy the Solstice App with MSI&#160;or SCCM</h1>
        <p>For ease in centrally deploying the Solstice App, Mersive provides both MSI and SCCM installer packages of the Mersive Solstice app for Windows. MSI&#160;installers allow for a GUI-based installation on a local machine or GPO deployment in Active Directory, while the SCCM&#160;installer allows remote installation. Either method can be used by IT&#160;administrators to silently deploy the Mersive Solstice app and Mersive Solstice Conference drivers. Note that these admin-installed versions of the Mersive Solstice app and Solstice Conference drivers cannot be auto-updated by users upon connecting to a Pod running a newer version of Solstice. </p>
        <p>Go to one of the topics below to learn more about centrally deploying Mersive user applications using one of these methods. </p>
