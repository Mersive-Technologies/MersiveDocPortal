                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>1.2 // July 2021</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

                <h4>New Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Audio Routing Support.</b> Solstice Active Learning Facilitators can now route content audio along with video within a Solstice Active Learning room. To use this new feature, Active Learning Designers choose one Pod to play audio when content is routed within a Solstice Active Learning room by selecting the “Activate Audio Output” option within the desired team block’s settings. This prevents non-synchronized audio from playing when video with audio is routed to multiple displays within the room.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fixes and Enhancements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Automatic sync of the routing state between the Pod and Active Learning app.</b> Solstice now checks periodically to make sure that the routing shown within the Active Learning app is correct with what is being routed from the Pods.</li>
                    <li><b>Team block connection errors.</b> If a Pod is unreachable or offline, Active Learning Facilitators are prevented from creating connections to/from that Pod’s team block and an error shows within the Active Learning app.</li>
                    <li><b>Additional information added to room cards.</b> Information was added to the landing card for each room to allow users to more easily identify and select their desired room.</li>
                    <li><b>Updated furniture design and door placement.</b> When designing an Active Learning room, the app now has more realistic looking furniture and more accurate door placement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Resolved Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Additional app and routing bug fixes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Availability and Requirements of Software Updates</h4>
                <p>Active Learning 1.2 software upgrades are available for the Solstice Active Learning App (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android). For the latest features and best experience, upgrade your Solstice Pods to the latest version of Solstice.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>1.1 // September 2020</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <h4>New Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Enhanced In-Room Security.</b> Active Learning Administrators can now enable Solstice's screen key feature to require a screen key to be entered into the Active Learning app when a Facilitator attempts to connect to the room. The facilitator can enter a screen key displayed on any of the team table displays in the room in order to connect. This feature can be enabled in Solstice Cloud &gt;&#160;Active Learning tab.</li>
                    <li><b>Quicker Room Creation.</b> An Active Learning Administrator can now duplicate team blocks or entire room configurations. To remove some of the repetitive tasks in creating and configuring an Active Learning room, the administrator can duplicate a team block to keep layouts consistent and make team block creation less tedious. Similarly, in the case that a building has similar room layouts, the administrator can duplicate an entire room configuration.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fixes and Enhancements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Improved Performance.</b> Active Learning room can now support up to 25 Pods. Additionally, connection times to start mirroring have been reduced.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Resolved Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced disconnects when mirroring.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Availability and Requirements of Software Updates</h4>
                <p>Active Learning 1.1  software upgrades are available for the Solstice Active Learning App (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android). For the latest features and best experience, upgrade your Solstice Pods to the latest version of Solstice.</p>
