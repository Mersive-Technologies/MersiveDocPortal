    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Validate SES on Solstice Pods</h1>
        <p>There are a variety of ways to test that your Solstice Edge Server (SES) is set up correctly. Typing <code>sesinfo</code> in the SES command prompt displays the SES version, IP address, and proxy port number. Solstice Dashboard can also be used to check if things are working as expected.</p>
        <h2>Is SDS on SES Working?</h2>
        <p>In addition to configuring Pods, Solstice Dashboard can be used to view any Pods currently reporting their presence to the Solstice Discovery Service (SDS). This allows you to check whether Pods are configured correctly and confirm the that SDS instance running within SES is making Pods discoverable to the Solstice user app.</p>
        <p>In the SDS tab of Dashboard, set the <b>Primary SDS Host</b> to the SES IP address.  In the table shown below, Dashboard will then display the Pods that SDS within SES is making available for discovery.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Is Proxy on SES Working?</h2>
        <p>Solstice Dashboard can also be used to check that the SES proxy settings are correctly allowing Pods to reach the internet. Selecting a Pod and clicking the <b>Test Proxy Settings</b> button (in the Web Server Proxy section) will prompt the Pod to attempt both http and https connections to www.google.com. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Green <b>Success</b> results show that the Pod has successfully communicated with Google through the SES proxy, and the parent proxy, if configured.</p>
        <p>You can also test the negative case, that Pods are not able to access sites they should not have access, to in a couple of ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use <code>sesadm</code> to remove or comment out the www.google.com line from the Proxy Access List configuration file. (See <a href="SES-Configuration.htm">Configure SES</a> for details on using <code>sesadm</code>.) Exit <code>sesadm</code> to save configuration changes and try <b>Test Proxy Settings</b> in Solstice Dashboard again. This should produce <b>Failed</b> results.</li>
            <li>Similarly, remove or comment out the .mersive.com entry (used for updates) from the Proxy Access List in <span style="font-family: monospace;">sesadm</span>. Then go to the Licensing tab of Dashboard, select a Pod, and click <b>Check for Updates</b>. Dashboard should report it is unable to check for updates rather than providing the status of the Pod’s software.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p class="note">Ensure that SES is running before performing the tests above. The SES server being powered down will also cause Pods to be unable to communicate through the SES proxy.</p>
