        <h1>Monitor Your Deployment</h1>
        <p>The Monitor section of Solstice Cloud provides tools for monitoring your organization's Solstice deployment and alerting you to technical issues so they can be resolved before impacting meeting productivity. You may also monitor the subscription status of any Solstice Pods managed in Solstice Cloud for your organization and begin a streamlined subscription renewal process.</p>
        <p>The following pages are available under Monitor in the left navigation bar of Solstice Cloud:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Availability</b> provides tools for monitoring the connectivity status of large deployments of Solstice Pods. Graphs can alert you to Pods that are offline or experiencing uptime issues, with uptime/downtime details available for each Pod.</li>
            <li><b>Deployment</b> allows you to quickly see which Pods in your deployment need software updates or have lapsed Solstice Subscriptions. From there, quickly start a streamlined subscription renewal process by  generating a subscription renewal request. </li>
            <li><b>Alerts</b> allow you to passively monitor your deployment by enabling email alerts triggered by Solstice display events such as reboots or periods of unreachability. A log of past alert events is also available for review at any time.</li>
        </ul>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <p>To view which of your Solstice Pods have lapsed subscriptions and quickly generate a request to renew them:</p>

                <p><a name="ConfigureEmailAlerts"></a>Solstice Cloud allows you to configure automated email alerts if certain events occur, such as a Pod going offline. These alerts can be set to match the needs of your deployment and allow you to quickly detect and resolve issues.</p>
                <p class="tip">You can set up email alerts to go to certain email addresses by assigning specific Pods to a category and then configuring email alerts for that category.  For example, you could assign all the Pods at your Seattle headquarters to a category option for that location. Then you could configure an email alert to be sent to your Seattle-based IT administrator if there are technical issues with any of those Pods.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the left sidebar menu of Solstice Cloud, go to <b>Monitor</b> &gt; <b>Alerts</b>.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Alert Settings</b>, toggle the email alerts you wish to receive to enabled. The toggle switch and filter options turn blue when the alert is enabled.</li>
                    <li>To receive email alerts only for certain displays in your Solstice Cloud deployment:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Click <b>filter</b><![CDATA[  ]]><img src="../Resources/Images/i_kepler_filter.png" /> next to the corresponding email alert.
