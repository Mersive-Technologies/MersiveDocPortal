        <h1>App-Free Sharing to a Solstice Display</h1>
        <p>Solstice supports multiple app-free sharing options so that users can share their device screen to the Solstice display without needing the Solstice App. This allows for guest and occasional users to quickly share content in a Solstice room. Solstice supports app-free sharing using AirPlay, Miracast, browser-based sharing, or a standard HDMI connection. </p>

        <h3><a name="HowTo_Airplay_iOS"></a>How to Mirror Your iOS&#160;Device Screen Using AirPlay</h3>
        <p>Solstice supports full mirroring of iOS 7+ devices (Apple iPhones and iPads) that feature Apple’s AirPlay functionality. AirPlay mirroring is accomplished through the device’s native AirPlay feature, using a similar process as connecting to an Apple TV.  </p>
        <p class="note">If you are unable to mirror your iOS device using AirPlay, contact your IT administrator to make sure that AirPlay mirroring is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the iOS device is connected to the WiFi network used to connect to the Solstice display.</li>
            <li>Open the iOS Control Center:
            <ul><li>On an iPhone X or later, or an iPad with iPadOS 13 or later, swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen.</li><li>On an iPhone 8 or earlier or iOS 11 or earlier, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Tap the <b>Screen Mirroring</b> icon and select the desired Solstice display from the list that appears.</li>
            <li>If the desired Solstice display does not appear in the AirPlay menu of your device, open the Solstice App and connect to the desired display, then repeat steps 2 and 3.</li>
            <li>If prompted for an AirPlay code, enter the screen key visible on the Solstice display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>
            <li>To stop mirroring your screen to the display, open the iOS Control Center again, tap the Screen Mirroring icon for the connected Pod, then tap <b>Stop Mirroring</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="tip">An AirPlay option may also appear when viewing photos or videos in iOS. Photos and videos shared via AirPlay generally appear full screen on the Solstice display.</p>

AirPlay mirroring is accomplished through a device’s native AirPlay feature, using a process similar to connecting to an Apple TV.</p>
        <p class="note">If you are unable to mirror your macOS device using AirPlay, contact your IT administrator to make sure that AirPlay mirroring is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the macOS device is connected to the WiFi network used to connect to the Solstice display.</li>

            <li>To stop mirroring your screen to the display, select either the <b>AirPlay</b> icon or <b>Control Panel</b> &gt; <b>Screen Mirroring</b> from the menu bar. This will show the active AirPlay connection. Select the name of the Solstice display to disconnect.</li>

        <h3><a name="howto_Miracast"></a>How to Mirror Your Windows Device Screen Using Miracast</h3>

            <li>From the list of wireless displays available, select the Solstice display.
            If the display is enabled for Miracast but you do not see it in the list of available displays, try scrolling down to ensure it is not hidden.

If this occurs, just turn Wi-Fi off on your Windows device, then turn it back on again to refresh the list of available Miracast WFD devices.</p></li>
            <li>If prompted for a PIN, enter the screen key from the display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>

        <p>The Solstice Gen3 Pod allows users to connect a laptop computer directly into the Pod using an HDMI cable connected from their laptop to the HDMI-in port on the front of the Pod. This allows users to share a wired content source to the display. The wired desktop sharing will appear in the collaboration session like any other post, and will be able to be controlled by any user in the session that has the Solstice app.</p>
