        <p>When enabled, Solstice scans the environment (such as WiFi SSIDs and Bluetooth) to estimate the approximate geographic location of Pods. This allows Solstice app users to quickly connect to a Pod that they are physically nearby and enables Solstice to detect and auto-disconnect users when they leave a meeting while still connected and sharing to a Pod.</p>
