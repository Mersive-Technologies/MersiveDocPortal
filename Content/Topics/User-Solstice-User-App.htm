        <h1>The Mersive Solstice App</h1>
        <p>Meeting and collaboration session participants can connect to a Solstice display with the Mersive Solstice app, which can be installed on Windows and macOS laptops, as well as Android and iOS tablets and phones, to wirelessly share content to the Solstice display and share the Solstice display to remote video conference participants. The user device and Solstice display must be connected to the same network.</p>
        <p>The Mersive Solstice app may be installed in one of two ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download the app from <a href="https://www.mersive.com/download/" target="_blank">mersive.com/download</a>.</li>
            <li>Download the app directly from the Solstice Pod by visiting the URL shown on the Solstice display. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supported Operating Systems </h3>
        <p>The Mersive Solstice app is supported on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices running the follow operating systems. Operating systems marked with an asterisk (*)&#160;support Solstice video conference connection capabilities. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows 8, 10*, 11*</li>
            <li>Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022</li>
            <li>macOS Catalina*, Big Sur*, Monterey*<p class="note">Mersive recommends upgrading to macOS Monterey for Mac M1 laptops since testing shows it to be more stable than macOS Big Sur, particularly for users who regularly host video conferences with Solstice.</p></li>
            <li>iOS versions 14, 15</li>
            <li>Android versions 11, 12</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other Requirements </h3>
        <p>The version of your Mersive Solstice app in relation to the version of Solstice running on the Solstice display you are connecting to can affect your experience. There are two different compatibility requirements, depending on how you intend to use Solstice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For content sharing, control, and markup capabilities, newer versions of the Solstice app are supported when used with a Solstice Pod within three (3) minor software versions of the app. For example, a user with the 5.5 Solstice app will be able to share content to Solstice Pods running software versions 5.5, 5.4, or 5.3, as well as use markup tools and control sharing options.</li>
            <li>However, to use Solstice to connect to a video conference, the version of the Mersive Solstice app and Solstice Conference drivers should be the same version as the software running on the Solstice Pod. Earlier versions of the Mersive Solstice app may require the versions to match exactly to connect Solstice resources to a video conference. Starting in version 5.5.1, users will be warned about mismatching versions but will still be able to share the Solstice display and access room cameras and mics connected to the Solstice Pod.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Change Your Mersive Solstice App Settings</h3>
        <p>Change how your device interacts with Solstice by opening the Mersive Solstice app and going to <b>Settings</b> in the left navbar. Changes to app settings are immediately saved. Find more information about each setting option below: </p>
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">General
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Your Display Name</b>: How your name will appear in the collaboration session.</li>
            <li><b>Notifications</b>: Set which notifications you would like to receive: <b>None</b>, <b>Critical</b>, or <b>All</b> notifications. </li>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/info_UserAppNotificationsOffConfWarning.flsnp" />
            <li><b>Solstice Discovery Service Address</b>:  If your organization has implemented Solstice Discovery Service (SDS), the SDS IP address should be entered here. This is one of the ways that Solstice displays on your organization’s network appear in your list of available displays. For more information on the SDS address for your organization, contact your IT administrator.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Control
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quick Share Desktop</b>: If enabled, Solstice will automatically share your desktop to the Solstice display after connecting. </li>
            <li><b>Auto share audio</b>: If enabled, audio will automatically be streamed to the Solstice display with Desktop and App Window shares.</li>
            <li><b>Hide on desktop share</b>: If enabled, the Solstice app window will be automatically hidden when you share your desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Solstice Location Service</b>: If enabled and location services are turned on for the Solstice display, the Solstice app will reorder the list of discovered Pods to show displays that are closest to you first, streamlining the connection process by allowing you to quickly connect to displays you are physically near. <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><b>Auto-disconnect sensitivity menu</b>: Enabling the Solstice Location Service also allows Solstice to learn over time the location of meeting spaces. The app can then automatically prompt you to disconnect after leaving a meeting while still sharing and connected to a Pod. Use this menu to turn on auto-disconnect functionality and set the sensitivity that location services will use to automatically disconnect the device.<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/info_UserAutoDiscntSensitivityWiFiNote.flsnp" /></li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Extended Presentation Mode</b>: If enabled, PowerPoint slideshows shared in the Solstice app will show only the presentation slides on the Solstice display. Presenters should enable Presenter View in PowerPoint to view their speaker notes and access other presenter tools on their laptop. This feature is currently available on Windows.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conference
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Calendar integration</b>: You can integrate your personal Microsoft 365 calendar with your Mersive Solstice app, allowing Solstice to detect and auto-launch scheduled video conferences on your calendar when you connect to a Solstice display. This is supported for Windows and macOS laptops only. See below to learn how to <a href="#integrate_pcal">integrate your calendar</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Conference HotKey</b>: This setting allows you to configure a shortcut command to quickly open the Room Camera + Mic panel of the Mersive Solstice app after connecting to a Solstice Pod. From this location, you can see upcoming video conference meetings on your integrated Microsoft 365 calendar and turn on access to room cameras and audio devices connected to the Solstice Pod. By default, the hotkey setting is Ctrl+Alt+C on Windows and Cmd+Opt+C on macOS. </li>
            <li><b>Share Pod Display</b>: When enabled, this setting allows you to share the Solstice display's collaboration space to your video conference. In your conferencing software, the Solstice display will appear as a virtual display (usually Screen 2 or Monitor 2) that can be shared with the meeting. Disabling this feature may improve performance on some devices.</li>
