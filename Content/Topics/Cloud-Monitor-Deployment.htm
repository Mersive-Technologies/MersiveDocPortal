        <h1>Monitor Your Deployment</h1>
        <p>Solstice Cloud provides tools to monitor your organization's Solstice deployment and alert you to technical issues so they can be resolved before impacting meeting productivity. You may quickly check the status of large deployments by identifying offline Pods, or passively monitor your deployment by enabling email alerts triggered by Solstice display events such as reboots or periods of unreachability. </p>
        <p>You may also monitor  Solstice Subscriptions for your Pods in Solstice Cloud. Quickly see which Pods in your deployment have expired Solstice Subscriptions and streamline the renewal process by having the Solstice Cloud Subscription wizard generate a subscription renewal request. </p>

In both the Deployment and Availability tables, the column furthest to the left displays status icons. A yellow triangle  <img src="../Resources/Images/i_yellowTriangle_lapsed_17x15.png" style="width: 17px;height: 15px;" />  indicates a Pod's Solstice Subscription has lapsed. <p class="tip">Click the sort <img src="../Resources/Images/I_sortIcon.png" /> icon at the top of the status column to display Pods with lapsed subscriptions grouped together. </p></li>
                    <li>Mouse over a yellow triangle icon and click <b>Learn More</b> in the tip box that appears.</li>

                <p><a name="ConfigureEmailAlerts"></a>Solstice Cloud allows you to configure automated email alerts if certain events occur, such as a Pod going offline. These alerts can be set to match the needs of your deployment and allow you to quickly detect and resolve issues.</p>
                <p class="tip">You can set up email alerts to go to certain email addresses by assigning specific Pods to a category and then configuring email alerts for that category.  For example, you could assign all the Pods at your Seattle headquarters to a category option for that location. Then you could configure an email alert to be sent to your Seattle-based IT administrator if there are technical issues with any of those Pods.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the left sidebar menu of Solstice Cloud, go to <b>Monitor</b> &gt; <b>Alerts</b>.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Alert Settings</b>, toggle the email alerts you wish to receive to enabled. The toggle switch and filter options turn blue when the alert is enabled.</li>
                    <li>To receive email alerts only for certain displays in your Solstice Cloud deployment:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Click <b>filter</b><![CDATA[  ]]><img src="../Resources/Images/i_kepler_filter.png" /> next to the corresponding email alert. The categories that Pod alerts may be filtered by will appear as dropdown menus.</li><li>Select options in each category to define which Pods you wish to receive alerts for. Selected options appear below the menus.</li><li>To remove an individual selected filter option, click the <img src="../Resources/Images/i_XCircle-Clear.png" /> icon next to the option. Use <b>remove all</b> to clear all the previously selected filters.</li></ol></li>

            <p>In both the Monitor &gt; Deployment and Monitor &gt; Availability tables (accessible from the left sidebar menu of Solstice Cloud), the list of Solstice Pods can be filtered by your available categories.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In both the Monitor &gt; Deployment and Monitor &gt; Availability tables (accessible from the left sidebar menu of Solstice Cloud), the list of Solstice Pods can be filtered by your available categories. </p>
                <p>Data will only be exported for Pods that currently match your search or filter criteria. This will include both the Pods displayed on the current page as well as Pods contained on additional pages that may not be currently displayed on the screen. For example, if your table is set to display 25 items per page, but there are 30 pods in the list, data for the five currently undisplayed pods will be exported. Additionally, only the columns that are currently displayed—that is, columns selected from the Manage Column check-boxes—will be exported.</p>
                <p>When the table shows all the Pods and columns you want to export, click <b>Export to CSV</b>.</p>
                <p>For example, to display all the data for all the Pods:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clear all filters by clicking the <img src="../Resources/Images/i_XCircle-Clear.png" /> in any search fields or on any filter labels.</li>
                    <li>At the bottom of the screen, click <b>Export to CSV</b>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Your browser should download the CSV file to its downloads directory.</p>
