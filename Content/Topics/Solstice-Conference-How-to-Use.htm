        <h1>How to Use Solstice Conference</h1>
        <p>These instructions outline steps for <b>meeting hosts</b> to use Solstice Conference to connect their video conference to Solstice content sharing and USB&#160;peripherals. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><iframe width="550" height="310" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNGHi-czMa8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

        <h3>Scheduled Conferences vs Unscheduled Conferences</h3>
        <p>Scheduled conferences are those which are scheduled either on a room calendar integrated with the Solstice Pod or on a personal calendar integrated in the Mersive Solstice app. The details for the conference – meeting ID, passcode, URL, etc. – must be included in the body of the scheduled event. Integrating a room or personal calendar, along  with Solstice Pod configuration, enables one-step starts for Solstice-connected video conferences. See <a href="#Launch">Launch a Scheduled Video Conference</a> for more details. Mersive recommends enabling one-step starts for video conferences for the best user experience. </p>
        <p>The Mersive Solstice app can connect Solstice content sharing and Pod-connected room peripherals to a video conference not previously scheduled on an integrated calendar. In this scenario, the video conference needs to be started separately using the host's preferred conferencing service. See <a href="#Bridge">Bridge an In-progress Meeting to Solstice Conference</a> for more details.</p>
        <h3><a name="Using"></a>Using Solstice Conference with Dual Displays</h3>
        <p>If the Pod is using dual display monitors, the display shared to the conference will be the display connected to HDMI 1 of the Pod. The screen connected to HDMI 2 will be labeled as a Private Display and will be visible to participants in the room but will not be shared as part of the conference. In the Mersive Solstice app layout screen, the display shared with the conference is the screen on the left.</p>
