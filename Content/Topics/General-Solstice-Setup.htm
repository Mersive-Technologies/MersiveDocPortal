        <h1>Solstice Setup</h1>
        <p>The Solstice Pod leverages existing TCP/IP-based networking. Since the Solstice Pod is a network-attached device, IT administration and Network Security should be involved in designing an appropriate deployment. </p>
        <p>Before you deploy Solstice, it is recommended that you read the information below and ensure your network meets the necessary requirements. </p>
        <p class="tip">For security-conscious environments, initial configurations for each of your Pods can take place on a standalone network prior to being deployed on your enterprise network. This will ensure that your Pods are configured to be secure before being attached to your network. </p>
        <h2>System Components</h2>
        <p>Physical setup and configuration of a Solstice-enabled room is straightforward. The system only requires a few components. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Solstice Pod.</b> The Solstice Pod is a network-attached wireless collaboration device. It provides a Solstice display space for wireless content sharing and collaboration and supports bring-your-own-meeting (BYOM) video conferencing with <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> <a href="Solstice-Conference-Introduction.htm" target="_blank">Solstice Conference</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> <a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/solstice-conference-introduction.htm">Solstice Conference</a></MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Display monitors.</b> Connect the Solstice Pod to up to two display monitors via HDMI to view content shared to the Solstice display. </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>USB room camera and/or audio devices (optional).</b>  To turn your Solstice room into a BYOM video conferencing room with <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> <a href="Solstice-Conference-Introduction.htm" target="_blank">Solstice Conference</a>,</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> <a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/solstice-conference-introduction.htm">Solstice Conference</a>,</MadCap:conditionalText> attach a USB room camera, microphone, and/or speakers to the Solstice Pod via USB. </li>
            <li><b>User devices.</b> These devices are brought to the room by users attending a Solstice collaboration session and are used to share content to the Solstice display.  User devices can share to the Solstice display using the Mersive Solstice app, or a variety of app-free sharing options (AirPlay, Miracast, browser-based sharing, HDMI&#160;input). Video conference hosts may also use laptop devices to share the Solstice display with a video conference.</li>
            <li><b>Mersive Solstice app.</b> The Mersive Solstice app is installed on user devices and is used to share and control the Solstice display. The Mersive Solstice app can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.mersive.com/download">mersive.com/download</a>. It can also be deployed centrally for Windows devices using <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> <a href="Admin-Client-Installs.htm">MSI or SCCM</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> <a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/admin-client-installs.htm">MSI or SCCM</a></MadCap:conditionalText> installers. For users  unable to install the app on their device, multiple app-free sharing options are supported, such as AirPlay, Miracast, browser-based sharing, or wired HDMI input. </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Ethernet (recommended).</b> Mersive recommends connecting your Pods to an Ethernet network for best performance. The Solstice Pod can be connected to Ethernet, a wireless network, and up to 3 VLANs simultaneously. </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>Physical Setup Tips</h2>
        <p>Because the Solstice Pod does not store user credential information, unencrypted passwords, or users’ data that has been shared to the Solstice display, Pods do not have to be located in secure locations. However, other considerations related to theft and environmental conditions should be considered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solstice supports plug-and-play USB&#160;devices. Devices, such as room cameras, should be connected to the Pod via USB and must be in-room. View list of <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> <a href="Solstice-Conference-Supported-Peripherals.htm" target="_blank">supported devices</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> <a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/pdf/solsticeconferencesupportedperipherals.pdf">supported devices</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText> DSPs and other processing hubs may not be compatible and should be avoided. </li>
            <li>Display monitors must be directly connected to a Solstice Pod through HDMI video cables to an HDMI&#160;port on the back of the Pod. </li>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/info_PodAudioOutNote.flsnp" />
            <li>
                Select an appropriate physical mounting solution for the Pod that cannot be detached. Consider the use of mounting locks and/or hidden VESA mounting systems behind the display. Specific mounting orientation is not an important factor as the Pod is operational in any orientation.</li>
            <li>  Ensure that appropriate environmental controls have been taken into account. The device should operate within an ambient temperature range of 0° C (32° F) to 50° C (122° F). This may require ventilation or active airflow.  Solstice Pods should never be stacked on top of each other.</li>
            <li>The Pod should not be mounted in direct contact with a surface that exceeds 30° C (86° F).</li>
        </ul>
