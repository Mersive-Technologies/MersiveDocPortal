                <h4>New Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Settings page in Solstice Active Learning app.</b> A Settings page has been added to the Solstice Active Learning app to provide users and administrators greater control over access and display sharing options. The Settings page is accessible from the global drop-down menu in the upper-right corner. The following settings can be configured:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><b>Require password for logout.</b> This setting may be enabled to require the user to enter the password to log out of the active account. This helps learning facilitators who need to access the Active Learning app in a learning space but may not know the account password avoid locking themselves out of the app.</li><li><b>Set primary display sharing mode.</b> Learning facilitators or system admins may now choose how primary display content appears when it is routed to a team display. There are two available layout modes: Full Screen (default), in which primary display content covers content posts shared by team members to the individual team display, and Side by Side, in which team content posts appear in a sidebar format next to the primary display content. <b>Note:</b> In Full Screen mode, a banner will appear on team displays to show that the content has been shared from the primary display.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Mobile device management with Jamf for iPadOS. Mobile device management (MDM) support has been added to allow administrators to centrally deploy and configure the Solstice Active Learning app for iPadOS using an Apple MDM platform such as Jamf. Admins may centrally key one, both, or neither of the Solstice Active Learning app settings (described above) to a desired value. When a key is included in the MDM configuration file, users cannot modify the corresponding setting in their app. If a key is omitted from the configuration file, control of that setting is left to the user.</p>
                        <p>Currently supported MDM keys in Solstice Active Learning for iPadOS are as follows:</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Save username upon login.</b> Users may now select a checkbox on the login screen to have the Solstice Active Learning app save their username for future logins.</li>
                    <li><b>iOS app support for iPad mini.</b> The Solstice Active Learning app for iOS client is now built to support new Apple devices such as the iPad mini.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fixes and Enhancements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ease-of-use navigation updates for the rooms list.</b> A number of navigation improvements have been made to the rooms list in the Solstice Active Learning app to help room designers and facilitators better access and manage their learning rooms.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><b>Rooms listed alphabetically.</b> Configured rooms in the app now sort in alphabetical order, making it easier for users to locate a desired room.</li><li><b>Return to previous list location.</b> After a user exits after editing or viewing a room configuration, they will be returned to their previous location in the room list.</li><li><b>Scrolling fixed on Windows.</b> The rooms list will no longer auto-scroll to the bottom of the list in the Windows app, making it easier for users to locate a room in the middle of the list.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><b>Improved error messaging.</b> More informative and user friendly error messages have been defined in the Solstice Active Learning app to help users better understand and resolve issues they might encounter.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><b>Login connection failure.</b> If a user’s login fails due to a network connection failure or timeout, the user will see an error message that prompts them to check their network connection.</li><li><b>Reload rooms list button.</b> If the rooms list fails to load, users will now see an accurate error message and will be offered a Retry button to reload the rooms list.</li></ul></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Resolved Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any active routing of content between displays in a room will now be automatically terminated when a user exits or logs out of the Solstice Active Learning app. Any instant overlay messages shown on displays will also be automatically cleared upon exit or logout. If the user then reconnects to the same room, active routing connections will display accurately as having been reset.</li>
                    <li>Chairs placed within room blocks will no longer move and appear in a different place after a learning designer adds or duplicates an existing team block, saves and exits the new block, and returns to view or edit the room.</li>
                    <li>Clicking the caret in the upper right of the Solstice Active Learning app window will now open the menu on all pages of the Solstice Active Learning app.</li>
                    <li>Switching between the buttons used to communicate instant overlay messages (such as “Eyes up front”) to team blocks now results in only one message being highlighted at a time to accurately indicate to the learning facilitator which message is being displayed.
</li>
                    <li>The message Reset button will now clear instant overlay messages (such as “Eyes up front”) from all displays in the room.
</li>
                    <li>A banner identifying the source of shared content will appear at the top of a display when content is being routed from the primary display to one or more team displays in Full Screen mode.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Availability and Requirements of Software Updates</h4>
                <p>Active Learning 1.3 software upgrades are available for the Solstice Active Learning app on laptops and tablets (Windows, macOS, iPadOS, Android). For the latest features and best experience, upgrade your Solstice Pods to the latest version of Solstice.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>1.2.1 // September 2021</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <h4>Resolved Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Solstice Active Learning app will no longer incorrectly apply the same IP address to Pods that share the same display name, which resulted in identically named Pods displaying as offline. Organizations should update their Solstice Active Learning apps to version 1.2.1 and may need to recreate any affected active learning rooms designed in the app. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Availability and Requirements of Software Updates</h4>
                <p>Active Learning 1.2.1 software upgrades are available for the Solstice Active Learning App (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android). For the latest features and best experience, ensure your Solstice Pods are upgraded to the latest version of Solstice.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>1.2 // July 2021</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <h4>New Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Audio Routing Support.</b> Solstice Active Learning Facilitators can now route content audio along with video within a Solstice Active Learning room. To use this new feature, Active Learning Designers choose one Pod to play audio when content is routed within a Solstice Active Learning room by selecting the “Activate Audio Output” option within the desired team block’s settings. This prevents non-synchronized audio from playing when video with audio is routed to multiple displays within the room.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fixes and Enhancements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Team block connection errors.</b> If a Pod is unreachable or offline, Active Learning Facilitators are prevented from creating connections to/from that Pod’s team block and an error shows within the Active Learning app.</li>
                    <li><b>Additional information added to room cards.</b> Information was added to the landing card for each room to allow users to more easily identify and select their desired room.</li>
                    <li><b>Updated furniture design and door placement.</b> When designing an Active Learning room, the app now has more realistic looking furniture and more accurate door placement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Resolved Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Additional app and routing bug fixes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Availability and Requirements of Software Updates</h4>
                <p>Active Learning 1.2 software upgrades are available for the Solstice Active Learning App (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android). For the latest features and best experience, upgrade your Solstice Pods to the latest version of Solstice.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <h4>New Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Enhanced In-Room Security.</b> Active Learning Administrators can now enable Solstice's screen key feature to require a screen key to be entered into the Active Learning app when a Facilitator attempts to connect to the room. The facilitator can enter a screen key displayed on any of the team table displays in the room in order to connect. This feature can be enabled in Solstice Cloud &gt;&#160;Active Learning tab.</li>
                    <li><b>Quicker Room Creation.</b> An Active Learning Administrator can now duplicate team blocks or entire room configurations. To remove some of the repetitive tasks in creating and configuring an Active Learning room, the administrator can duplicate a team block to keep layouts consistent and make team block creation less tedious. Similarly, in the case that a building has similar room layouts, the administrator can duplicate an entire room configuration.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fixes and Enhancements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Improved Performance.</b> Active Learning room can now support up to 25 Pods. Additionally, connection times to start mirroring have been reduced.</li>
                </ul>
