        <h1>Design an Active Learning Space</h1>
        <p> Once the Pods have been connected to their team table displays and deployed on the network, Active Learning Designers can  virtually design and enable a new active learning space using the intuitive drag-and-drop interface in the Solstice Active Learning app. </p>
        <p class="note">To create and design rooms within the Solstice Active Learning app, a Solstice Cloud administrator must first <a href="Cloud-Roles-Permissions.htm#invite_users" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">invite users to create a Solstice Cloud account</a> and  assign them the Active Learning Designer user role. </p>
