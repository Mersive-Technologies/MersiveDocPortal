        <h1>Deploy the Solstice App with MSI&#160;or SCCM</h1>
        <p>For ease in centrally deploying the Solstice App, Mersive provides both MSI and SCCM installer packages of the Mersive Solstice app for Windows. MSI&#160;installers allows for a GUI-based installation on a local machine or GPO deployment in Active Directory, while the SCCM&#160;installer allows for a remote installation. Either of these methods can be used by your IT&#160;administrator to silently deploy the Mersive Solstice app and Mersive Solstice Conference drivers. Go to one of the topics below to learn more about how to centrally deploy Mersive user applications using one of these methods. </p>
