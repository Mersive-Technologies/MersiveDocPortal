        <h1>Solstice Video Room Integration</h1>
        <p>Starting in Solstice 5.5, Solstice Pods can automatically switch between a dedicated room system, such as a Zoom Room or Microsoft Teams Room, and the Solstice Pod's multi-source wireless content sharing and bring-your-own-meeting (BYOM)&#160;video&#160;conferencing support. Solstice Video Room Integration (VRI) can also support switching between Solstice and certain all-in-one video conferencing appliances.</p>

        <h2><a name="requirements"></a>VRI&#160;System Components &amp;&#160;Requirements</h2>
        <p>The following components and related configurations are required to integrate Solstice with a computer-based video room system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gen3 Solstice Pod running Solstice 5.5 or higher with an active Solstice Subscription<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Configure the Pod  with a static IP address or static hostname that can be resolved by the video room system device.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Device running Zoom Room or Microsoft Teams Room software <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Optional: Install the <a href="#install_SVRS">Solstice Video Room Service</a> on the supported video room system device.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Supported USB&#160;switcher that accepts RS-232 or HTTP-based API commands<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Configure any devices to be signaled by Solstice via API commands, such as the USB switch, to have a static domain name or IP address on the same network as the Solstice Pod.</li><li>Set the USB switch to route to the Zoom Room or Microsoft Teams Room device by default.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Optional: USB to RS-232 cord (for RS-232 USB&#160;switch)</li>
            <li>Display monitor and <a href="Solstice-Conference-Supported-Peripherals.htm" target="_blank">supported peripheral</a> video and audio devices</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="std_config"></a>Standard Solstice VRI Configuration</h3>
        <p>In a standard configuration with a video room system, the room system device and display monitor are connected to the Solstice Pod, and USB audio and video peripherals are connected to the Solstice Pod via a USB&#160;switch. The Pod can then be configured to automatically switch from displaying the video room system to using Solstice's wireless sharing and BYOM&#160;video conferencing as needed. The diagram below shows how these components are typically connected. </p>
        <p>See the <a href="#device_support">Device Support</a> section for more information about device requirements, tested USB&#160;switches, and supported RS-232 converters.</p>

        </p>
        <h3><a name="alt_config"></a>Appliance Solstice VRI&#160;Configuration</h3>
        <p>A second configuration is also possible to integrate Solstice with an all-in-one video conferencing appliance that contains a camera, microphone, and speakers and also accepts RS-232 or HTTP-based API commands. In this type of integration, the all-in-one appliance is connected to the Solstice Pod via HDMI-in and USB. The Solstice Pod can then be configured to send API commands to toggle the all-in-one device between its native functionality and  an external device mode that passes AV input and output to the Solstice Pod. </p>
        <p>See the <a href="#device_support">Device Support</a> section for more information about requirements for all-in-one video appliances and tested devices.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Attach the Solstice Pod to power and to the local Ethernet and wireless networks, as appropriate for your Solstice deployment.</li>
                    <li>The video room system (Zoom, Teams, etc.) device should also be powered on and connected to Ethernet on the same network as the Solstice Pod.</li>
                    <li>Connect a display monitor to one of the Solstice Pod’s HDMI outputs (HDMI 1 or HDMI&#160;2 on the back of the Pod). Mersive does not recommend using dual displays  in a VRI&#160;configuration at this time.</li>
                    <li>Connect the video room system device's HDMI output to the HDMI-in port on the front of the Solstice Pod.</li>
                    <li>Connect <a href="Solstice-Conference-Supported-Peripherals.htm" target="_blank">supported peripheral</a> cameras, speakers, and/or microphones to the USB switch's USB&#160;output ports. </li>
                    <li>Connect one of the USB ports on the back of the Solstice Pod to a USB input port on the USB&#160;switch.</li>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><a name="install_SVRS"></a>The Solstice Video Room Service runs on the video room device to optionally hide the Solstice connection message when a video room conference session is in progress. This lightweight service is quick to install and configure and should have no impact on video room system performance. It will be available shortly after the Solstice 5.5 release.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Download the Solstice Video Room Service from <a href="https://www.mersive.com/download-admin/">mersive.com/download-admin</a>. </li>
                    <li>Run <code>SolsticeVideoRoomService.msi</code> on the Windows video room system computer or NUC&#160;device to start the installer.</li>
                    <li>Enter the static hostname or static IP address of the Solstice Pod integrated with the video room system when prompted during the installation process.<p><img src="../Resources/Images/ex_VRI-SVRSInstallHostname.png" style="height: auto;width: 60%;" /></p></li>
                    <li> As a system service, the program will automatically start up with the room system device.</li>
                    <li>To change the hostname or IP address after the initial installation:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><p>Either edit the <code>PodHostname</code> value in the configuration file, usually located at:</p><p><code>C:\Program Files\Mersive Technologies, Inc\Solstice\SolsticeVideoRoomService\SolsticeVideoRoomService.exe.config</code></p></li><li>Or simply run the installer again and enter the new static hostname or IP address when prompted.</li></ol></li>
                    <li>The Solstice Video Room Service will signal the Pod to turn off the Solstice instructions overlay when a connected camera is in use for a video room call.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Solstice Video Room Service Limitations</h4>
                <p>The Solstice Video Room Service, which runs on Windows-based devices to disable the Solstice overlay during video room calls, does not currently work when an HDMI-in device is plugged into the computer running a Zoom Room. You can work around this issue in a number of ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disable the HDMI-in "camera" device in Windows' Device Manager on the Zoom Room computer. Since this prevents the HDMI-in device from being used with Zoom, this solution is most useful when the HDMI-in device is not intended to be used with the Zoom Room. One example of this might be when a meeting room controller such as the Logitech Tap is connected to the Zoom Room computer and the HDMI-in port on the Tap will not be used.</li>
                    <li>Embed Solstice connection instructions similar to those described in Step 3 above in a custom background for the Zoom Room.</li>
                    <li>Disable the Solstice custom connection instructions by clearing the <b>Instructions Text Overlay</b> box in the Video Room Integration configuration page.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the Solstice Video Room Service cannot be installed (such as on all-in-one video appliances), the Solstice connection instructions overlay will always show when non-Solstice meetings are hosted on the appliance. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you wish to turn off the Solstice custom connection instructions, clear the <b>Instructions Text Overlay</b> box in the Video Room Integration configuration page.</li>
                </ul>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Follow the directions below to use  either Solstice Cloud or Solstice Dashboard to set the HDMI-in behavior mode to Persistent Post for the Solstice Pod integrated with a video room system. </p>
                <p>In a video room system configuration, the video room display is configured as an HDMI-in post to the Solstice Pod. In Persistent Post mode, Solstice hides the room system post when users connect wirelessly to the Solstice Pod and reinstates it when all users have disconnected from Solstice.</p>
