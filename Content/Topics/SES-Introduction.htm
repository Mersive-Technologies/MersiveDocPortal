    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Solstice Edge Server (SES)</h1>
        <p>Solstice Edge Server (SES) is a virtual machine that is installed and run on an organization’s internal network to provide a single point of access for Solstice Pods to communicate with the internet. It is released as a virtual machine OVF file to be run within your VMware environment.</p>
        <p>SES also includes Mersive’s lightweight network application Solstice Discovery Service (SDS), which allows end users, whether they be employees or guests, to efficiently discover available Solstice Pods displays using their Solstice app.</p>
        <p class="note">Since Solstice Discovery Service (SDS) is now bundled into SES, customers no longer need to run SDS on a separate Windows computer or server on their network. Simply configure your Pods to communicate with SES instead. <a href="SDS-Introduction.htm" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Click here</a><a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/sds-introduction.htm" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Click here</a> for more information about SDS functionality. </p>
        <h3>Why Use SES? </h3>
        <p>Solstice Pods require internet access to update to the latest software version, as well as to reach the licensing server. Internet access is also required to manage Pods through Solstice Cloud, Mersive's cloud-based management portal.</p>
        <p>Some organizations may have security concerns about or policies that prohibit individual Pods accessing the internet directly. SES solves this problem by allowing Pods to use SES as a proxy to the internet. An organization only needs to allow a single SES instance access to the internet, and all Solstice Pod traffic will be routed through that one access point. By default, SES can only access the domains on the internet required by Solstice. (See <a href="SES-Configuration.htm#Proxy_Config">Proxy Configuration</a> for details.)</p>
        <h2>Solstice Edge Server Requirements</h2>
        <p>SES is delivered as a virtual machine (VM) in an Open Virtualization Format (OVF) and consists of two files that can be opened in a VMware environment. SES appears as an Ubuntu machine on your network, which can be configured to your needs.</p>
        <h3>VM Requirements for SES </h3>
        <p>The VM must be run on a machine with VMware vSphere 6.5 or later. The VMware virtual hardware should be version 13 or higher.</p>
        <p>When the VM is run, it is currently configured to use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 CPUs</li>
            <li>4 Gb RAM</li>
            <li>50 Gb storage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Network Requirements for SES </h3>
        <p>Mersive recommends that SES be given, at minimum, a 10 Gbps internet connection. This will be used primarily for Pods to access the internet for software updates, as well as for Solstice Cloud Management, if applicable. The amount of traffic generated by these uses is generally low except when a software update is being downloaded. Bandwidth used by Solstice content-sharing does not need to be considered since it is not routed through SES. </p>
        <h3>Open Network Ports for SES </h3>
        <p>For Solstice Pods to communicate with SES, the following <b>TCP ports</b> must be open on the internal network:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>22</b>- Needed for SSH access.</li>
            <li><b>3128</b>- Used for proxy communication from Pods to SES.</li>
            <li><b>53100</b> - Used to update information from SES to Pods.</li>
            <li><b>80, 53200, 53201, 53202</b> - Used for SDS traffic between Solstice Pods, Solstice app, and SDS.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How To Run the Solstice Edge Server VM</h2>
        <p>To start the SES virtual machine with VMware, there are two basic steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Import the SES .ovf file provided by Mersive into VMware.</li>
            <li>Start the VM.</li>
        </ol>
