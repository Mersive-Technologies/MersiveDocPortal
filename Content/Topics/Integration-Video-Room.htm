        <h1>Video Room Integration</h1>
        <p>Solstice Pods running Solstice 5.5 and higher can be configured to automatically switch between a dedicated video room system such as Zoom or Teams and the Solstice Pod's multi-source wireless content sharing and agnostic video&#160;conferencing support. Pods can also be configured to support switching between Solstice and a supported all-in-one video conferencing device such as the Poly Studio X30 or X50.</p>
        <h2>System Components</h2>
        <p>Use the following components to integrate Solstice with a computer-based video room system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gen3 Solstice Pod running Solstice 5.5 or higher (licensing?)</li>
            <li>Zoom Room or Microsoft Teams Room device</li>
            <li>Supported USB&#160;switcher that accepts RS-232 or REST API commands</li>
            <li>Display monitor, video, and audio peripherals</li>
            <li>Optional USB to RS-232 cord (for RS-232 switcher)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the video room system, display monitor, and USB audio and video peripherals (via a USB&#160;switching device) are connected to the Solstice Pod, Solstice 5.5 and higher can be configured to automatically switch between and the video room system and Solstice wireless sharing and agnostic video conferencing as needed. See supported USB&#160;Switches and supported all-in-one AV peripheral devices.</p>
        <p>More detailed components list needed?</p>

        </p>
        <p>A second configuration for all-in-one video conferencing devices, such as the Poly Studio X30 and X50, is also possible. In this configuration, the all-in-one device is connected to the Solstice Pod via HDMI-In and USB. API commands sent to the Poly Studio X30 and X50 switch audio and video to be sent to the Solstice Pod, so a USB&#160;switch is not needed.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In this configuration, it is recommended that digital signage be enabled on the dedicated room system (e.g., the Zoom Room or Microsoft Teams Room configuration) rather than configured through Solstice.</p>

        <h2>Requirements &amp;&#160;Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Because the Pod does not store user credential information, unencrypted passwords, or users’ data that has been shared to the display, the physical Pods do not have to be located in secure locations. However, other considerations related to theft and environmental conditions should be considered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solstice supports plug-and-plug USB&#160;devices. Devices, such as room cameras, should be connected to the Pod via USB and must be in-room. View list of<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> <a href="Solstice-Conference-Supported-Peripherals.htm" target="_blank">supported devices</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> <a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/pdf/solsticeconferencesupportedperipherals.pdf">supported devices</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText> Note&#160;that DSPs and other processing hubs may not be compatible and should be avoided. </li>
            <li>Display monitors must be directly connected to a Solstice Pod through HDMI video cables to an HDMI&#160;port on the back of the Pod. </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/info_PodAudioOutNote.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                Select an appropriate physical mounting solution for the Pod that cannot be detached. Consider the use of mounting locks and/or hidden VESA mounting systems behind the display. Specific mounting orientation is not an important factor as the Pod is operational in any orientation.</li>
            <li>  Ensure that appropriate environmental controls have been taken into account. The device should operate within an ambient temperature range of 0° C (32° F) to 50° C (122° F). This may require ventilation or active airflow.  Solstice Pods should never be stacked on top of each other.</li>
            <li>The Pod should not be mounted in direct contact with a surface that exceeds 30° C (86° F).</li>
        </ul>
