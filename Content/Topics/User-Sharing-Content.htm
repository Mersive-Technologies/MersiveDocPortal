        <h1>Sharing Content Using the Solstice App</h1>
        <p>Solstice improves meeting productivity and engagement with multi-participant content sharing, control, and markup. With the Mersive Solstice app installed on a laptop, tablet, or mobile device, users can share and control content on the display connected to a Solstice Pod. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">(For more information on how to download the Solstice app, see <a href="User-Solstice-User-App.htm">Mersive Solstice App</a>.)</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>Users can also use one of the supported app-free sharing options to share to the Solstice display if they don't have the Solstice app. See <a href="User-Sharing-Mirror-Device.htm">App-Free Sharing to a Solstice Display</a> to learn more about Solstice's app-free sharing options. </p>

        <h3>How to Share Content Using the Solstice App on a Laptop Device</h3>
        <p>On the Share tab of the Solstice desktop app, you can wirelessly share an unlimited amount of content to the Solstice display using any of the following options. As a note, the content shared to Solstice will never leave your device, only pixels will be streamed to the display. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Desktop:</b> Share a real-time view of your desktop mirrored to the display. The entire desktop, including any open application windows, will be shared in real-time. </li>
            <li><b>App Window:</b> Share a real-time view of only a single application window to the display. This sharing option allows you to maintain privacy by only sharing the single application window instead of your entire desktop. </li>
            <li><b>Media File:</b>&#160;Share media files such as images and videos saved locally on your laptop device to the display. Solstice supports image and video files up to 4K resolution. </li>
            <li>
                <p class="note">Solstice supports sharing a broad range of video types, but not all video files are supported. If a video file is not supported, you can use the Desktop sharing option to stream the video to the display. </p>
