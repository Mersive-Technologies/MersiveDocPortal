        <h1>Mirroring Your Screen to a Solstice Display</h1>
        <p>Users can also mirror their device screen to a Solstice display without needing to download the Solstice app by using one of two native streaming methods: Miracast (Windows devices) or Apple Airplay (MacOS and iOS devices). </p>
        <h2><a name="HowTo_Airplay_iOS"></a>Mirror Your iOS&#160;Device Screen Using AirPlay</h2>
        <p>Solstice supports full mirroring of iOS 7+ devices (Apple iPhones and iPads) that feature Apple’s AirPlay® functionality. AirPlay® mirroring is accomplished through the device’s native AirPlay® feature, using a similar process as connecting to an Apple TV.  </p>
        <p class="note">If you are unable to mirror your iOS device using AirPlay®, contact your IT administrator to make sure that AirPlay® mirroring is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the iOS device is on the WiFi network used to connect to the Solstice display.</li>
            <li>Swipe upward from the bottom or downward from the upper-right corner of your screen to open the iOS Control Center.</li>
            <li>Tap the <b>Screen Mirroring</b> button and select the desired Solstice display from the list that appears.</li>
            <li>If the desired display does not appear in the AirPlay® menu of your device, open the Solstice App and connect to the desired display, then repeat steps 2 and 3.</li>
            <li>If prompted, enter the screen key visible on the Solstice display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>
            <li>To stop mirroring your screen to the display, swipe upward from the bottom or downward from the upper-right corner of your screen to open the iOS Control Center, tap the <b>Airplay</b>® button, then tap <b>Stop Mirroring</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="HowTo_Airplay_macOS"></a>Mirror Your macOS&#160;Device Screen Using AirPlay</h2>
        <p>Solstice supports full mirroring of iOS 7+ devices (Apple iPhones and iPads) that feature Apple’s AirPlay® functionality. AirPlay® mirroring is accomplished through the device’s native AirPlay® feature, using a similar process as connecting to an Apple TV.  </p>
        <p class="note">If you are unable to mirror your iOS device using AirPlay®, contact your IT administrator to make sure that AirPlay® mirroring is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>

        </ol>
        <h2><a name="howto_Miracast"></a>Mirror Your Windows Device Screen Using Miracast</h2>
        <p>If your organization has enabled streaming with Miracast, users without the Solstice user app can connect and share their screen to the display using Miracast capabilities on their Windows device. If you are unable to Miracast to the display, contact your IT administrator to make sure that Miracast is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <p class="note">Screen mirroring on an Android device may not support audio streaming. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On your Windows laptop, hit the <b>Windows key + P</b>.</li>
            <li>In the menu that appears, click <b>Connect to a wireless display</b>. A list of displays appears. <b>Note:</b> If the display is enabled for Miracast but you do not see it in the list of available displays, try scrolling down to ensure it is not hidden.</li>
            <li>Select the Solstice display. If prompted for a PIN, enter the screen key from the display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>
            <li>To change how your device handles the display, hit the <b>Windows key + P</b>, then select one of the display options that appear. Mersive recommends using the <b>Duplicate</b> setting when streaming with Miracast.</li>
            <li>To stop Miracast streaming to the display, hit the <b>Windows key + P</b>, click <b>Connect to a wireless display</b>, then click <b>Disconnect</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Share Your Desktop via HDMI</h2>
        <p>The Solstice Gen3 Pod allows users to connect a laptop PC directly into the Pod using an HDMI cable connected from their laptop to the HDMI-in port on the front of the Pod. This allows users to share a wired content source to the display. The wired desktop sharing will appear in the collaboration session like any other post, and will be able to be controlled by any user in the session that has the Solstice app.</p>
        <h2><a name="howto_Share_broswer"></a>Share Your Desktop Using a Web Browser (No&#160;App Required)</h2>
        <p>If you are unable to download the Solstice app, there is an install-free sharing option that allows you to connect and share to Solstice using a web browser. This functionality is supported on Windows, macOS, Chromebook, and Linux devices for the Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Chromium web browsers.</p>
        <p class="note">Available sharing options vary by browser. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect your laptop device to a network listed on the Solstice display.</li>
            <li>Open a Chrome or Firefox web browser and go to the URL on the display that corresponds to the network you're connected to. </li>
            <li>Click <b>Launch in browser</b> option.</li>
            <li>If you see a security warning in your browser, click <b>Advanced</b>, and then the option to proceed to the URL. </li>
            <li>Enter in the screen key shown on the room display (if prompted) and your name, then click <b>Launch</b>.</li>
            <li>Select the sharing option you wish to use. For example, you may be presented with options to share your entire screen, an application window, or a browser tab. </li>
            <li>Click  to <b>Share</b> or <b>Allow</b> to share it to the display. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="warning">If you are on the Catalina version of macOS and are having trouble using browser-based sharing, you may need to enable permissions within your system's privacy settings for the browser to utilize screen recording. </p>
