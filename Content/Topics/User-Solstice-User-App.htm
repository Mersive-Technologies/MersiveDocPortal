        </h4>

            <li><b>Notifications</b>: Set which notifications you would like to receive: None, Critical, or All notifications. </li>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Solstice-App-Notifications-Conference.flsnp" />
            <li><b>Solstice Discovery Service Address</b>:  If your organization has implemented the Solstice Discovery Service (SDS), the SDS IP address is entered here. This is one of the ways that the displays on your organization’s network appear in the Discovered Displays tab. For more information on SDS and the corresponding IP address, contact your IT administrator.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Control
        </h4>

            <li><b>Hide on desktop share</b>: If enabled, the Solstice Client user app will automatically hide when you share your desktop.</li>
            <li><b>Solstice Location Service</b>: If the Solstice display has location services enabled, the Solstice app will reorder the list of discovered Pods to show displays that are closest to you first, allowing you to quickly connect to the display that you are physically nearby, streamlining the connection process. </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.5-4_Release"><b>Extended Presentation Mode</b> (not currently available on macOS): With this feature is enabled, a PowerPoint presentation shared to the Solstice display will display the slides only in the collaboration space, while presenters can still see their presentation notes on their laptop screen. Share the PowerPoint app window, not your whole desktop, to access this functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conference
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Calendar integration</b>: You can now integrate your O365 calendar with your Solstice app, allowing Solstice to detect and auto-launch any scheduled web conferences on your calendar when you connect to a Solstice display. This is supported for Windows or macOS laptops only.</li>
            <li><b>Conference HotKey</b>: This setting allows you to configure the shortcut command to quickly open the Solstice Conference pop-up without having to click the icon in your system tray. By default, the hotkey setting is 'Ctrl +&#160;Alt +&#160;C'. </li>
            <li><b>Share Pod Display</b>: When enabled, this setting allows you to share the Pod display in your conference. In your conferencing software, the Pod will appear as a virtual display that can be shared with the meeting. Disabling this feature can improve performance on some host devices.</li>
        </ul>
