        <h1>Mirroring Your Screen to a Solstice Display</h1>
        <p>Users can also mirror their device screen to a Solstice display without needing to download the Solstice app by using one of two native streaming methods: Miracast (Windows devices) or Apple Airplay (MacOS and iOS devices). </p>
        <h2><a name="HowTo_Airplay_iOS"></a>Mirror Your iOS&#160;Device Screen Using AirPlay</h2>
        <p>Solstice supports full mirroring of iOS 7+ devices (Apple iPhones and iPads) that feature Apple’s AirPlay functionality. AirPlay mirroring is accomplished through the device’s native AirPlay feature, using a similar process as connecting to an Apple TV.  </p>
        <p class="note">If you are unable to mirror your iOS device using AirPlay, contact your IT administrator to make sure that AirPlay mirroring is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the iOS device is connected to the WiFi network used to connect to the Solstice display.</li>
            <li>Open the iOS Control Center:
            <ul><li>On an iPhone X or later, or an iPad with iPadOS 13 or later, swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen.</li><li>On an iPhone 8 or earlier or iOS 11 or earlier, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Tap the <b>Screen Mirroring</b> icon and select the desired Solstice display from the list that appears.</li>
            <li>If the desired Solstice display does not appear in the AirPlay menu of your device, open the Solstice App and connect to the desired display, then repeat steps 2 and 3.</li>
            <li>If prompted for an AirPlay code, enter the screen key visible on the Solstice display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>
            <li>To stop mirroring your screen to the display, open the iOS Control Center again, tap the Screen Mirroring icon for the connected Pod, then tap <b>Stop Mirroring</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="HowTo_Airplay_macOS"></a>Mirror Your macOS&#160;Device Screen Using AirPlay</h2>
        <p>If your organization has enabled streaming with AirPlay, users without the Solstice user app can connect and share their screen to the display using AirPlay capabilities on macOS devices (High Sierra and later). AirPlay mirroring is accomplished through a device’s native AirPlay feature, using a process similar to connecting to an Apple TV.</p>
        <p class="note">If you are unable to mirror your macOS device using AirPlay, contact your IT administrator to make sure that AirPlay mirroring is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the macOS device is connected to the WiFi network used to connect to the Solstice display.</li>
            <li>From the top menu bar, either select the <b>AirPlay</b> icon or open the Control Panel from the top bar and select <b>Screen Mirroring</b>. Then select the desired Solstice display.</li>
            <li>If prompted for an AirPlay code, enter the 4-digit screen key visible on the Solstice display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>
            <li>To stop mirroring your screen to the display, select either the <b>AirPlay</b> icon or <b>Control Panel</b> &gt; <b>Screen Mirroring</b> from the menu bar. This will show the active AirPlay connection. Select the name of the Solstice display to disconnect.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="howto_Miracast"></a>Mirror Your Windows Device Screen Using Miracast</h2>
        <p>If your organization has enabled streaming with Miracast, users without the Solstice user app can connect and share their screen to the display using Miracast capabilities on their Windows device. If you are unable to Miracast to the display, contact your IT administrator to make sure that Miracast is enabled for the Solstice display.</p>
        <p class="note">Screen mirroring on an Android device may not support audio streaming. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On a Windows 10 laptop, use <b>Windows key + K</b> or click the <b>Connect</b> button in the Windows notification center (found on the far right end of taskbar) to open the Connect pane.            </li>
            <li>From the list of displays available wireless displays, select the Solstice display.
            <p class="note">If the display is enabled for Miracast but you do not see it in the list of available displays, try scrolling down to ensure it is not hidden.</p></li>
            <li>If prompted for a PIN, enter the screen key from the display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.</li>
            <li>To stop Miracast streaming to the display, open the Connect pane and click <b>Disconnect</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Share Your Desktop via HDMI</h2>
        <p>The Solstice Gen3 Pod allows users to connect a laptop PC directly into the Pod using an HDMI cable connected from their laptop to the HDMI-in port on the front of the Pod. This allows users to share a wired content source to the display. The wired desktop sharing will appear in the collaboration session like any other post, and will be able to be controlled by any user in the session that has the Solstice app.</p>
        <h2><a name="howto_Share_broswer"></a>Share Your Desktop Using a Web Browser (No&#160;App Required)</h2>
        <p>If you are unable to download the Solstice app, there is an install-free sharing option that allows you to connect and share to Solstice using a web browser. This functionality is supported on Windows, macOS, Chromebook, and Linux devices for the Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Chromium web browsers.</p>
        <p class="note">Available sharing options vary by browser. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect your laptop device to a network listed on the Solstice display.</li>
            <li>Open a Chrome or Firefox web browser and go to the URL on the display. If multiple ULRs are listed, choose the one that corresponds to the same network you're connected to. </li>
            <li>Click the link to share using your web browser.
            <p class="note">Don't see a link on your browser for sharing your screen? Your IT administrator may need to enable this feature for the Solstice Pod display.</p></li>
            <li>If you see a security warning in your browser, click <b>Advanced</b>, and then the option to proceed to the URL. </li>
            <li>Enter in the screen key shown on the room display (if prompted) and your name, then click <b>Launch</b>.</li>
            <li>Select the sharing option you wish to use. For example, you may be presented with options to share your entire screen, an application window, or a browser tab, as well as whether to share audio. </li>
            <li>Click  to <b>Share</b> or <b>Allow</b> to share the selected content to the Solstice display. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="warning">If you are on the Catalina version of macOS and are having trouble using browser-based sharing, you may need to enable permissions within your system's privacy settings for the browser to utilize screen recording. </p>
